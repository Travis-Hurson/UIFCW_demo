## Welcome to UIFCW 2023!

## Prerequisites

1. A laptop, preferably a Mac or Linux system.  A Windows system can also work by either downloading Git-Bash or using a conference-provided AWS login.
3. Verify that you have git (or Git-Bash on Windows) installed on your system: `git --version` (Note that version 2.30+ is recommended for working with UFS repositories; not required for today)
   - If you have root privileges, then you can follow [these instructions for updating your version of git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
   - If you are on a Windows machine, you can download and install [Git-Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
4. Next, create a GitHub account if you do not already have one: [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/signup)
